\usage{
calc.stError(dat,weights="hgew",b.weights=paste0("w",1:1000),year="jahr",var="povmd60",
                    fun="weightedRatio",cross_var=NULL,year.diff=NULL,
                    year.mean=3,bias=FALSE,add.arg=NULL,size.limit=20,cv.limit=10)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{either data.frame or data.table containing the survey data. Surveys can be a panel survey or rotating panel survey, but does not need to be. For rotating panel survey bootstrap weights can be created using \code{\link{draw.bootstrap}} and \code{\link{recalib}}.}

\item{weights}{character specifying the name of the column in \code{dat} containing the original sample weights. Used to calculate point estimates.}

\item{b.weights}{character vector specifying the names of the columns in \code{dat} containing bootstrap weights. Used to calculate standard errors.}

\item{year}{character specifying the name of the column in \code{dat} containing the sample years.}

\item{var}{character vector containing variable names in \code{dat} on which \code{fun} shall be applied for each sample year.}

\item{fun}{character specifying the function which will be applied on \code{var} for each sample year.
Possible arguments are \code{weightedRatio,weightedSum,sampSize,popSize} as well as any other function which returns a double or integer and uses weights as its second argument.}

\item{cross_var}{character vectors or list of character vectors containig variables in \code{dat}. For each list entry \code{dat} will be split in subgroups according to the containing variables as well as \code{year}.
The pointestimates are then estimated for each subgroup seperately. If \code{cross_var=NULL} the data will split into sample years by default.}

\item{year.diff}{character vectors, defining years for which the differences in the point estimate as well it's standard error is calculated. Each entry must have the form of \code{"year1 - year2"}. Can be NULL}

\item{year.mean}{integer, defining the range of years over which the sample mean of point estimates is additionally calcualted.}

\item{bias}{boolean, if TRUE the sample mean over the point estimates of the bootstrap weights is returned.}

\item{add.arg}{character specifying additional arguments for \code{fun}. Can be \code{NULL}.}

\item{size.limit}{integer defining a lower bound on the number of observations on \code{dat} in each group defined by \code{year} and the entries in \code{cross_var}.
Warnings are returned if the number of observations in a subgroup falls below \code{size.limit}. In addition the concerned groups are available in the function output.}

\item{cv.limit}{non-negativ value defining a upper bound for the standard error in relation to the point estimate. If this relation exceed \code{cv.limit}, for a point estimate, they are flagged and available in the function output.}
}
\value{
Returns a list containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{Estimates}: data.table containing yearly, differences and/or k year averages for estimates of \code{fun} applied to \code{var} as well as the corresponding standard errors, which are calculated using the bootstrap weights.
  \item \code{smallGroups}: data.table containing groups for which the number of observation falls below \code{size.limit}.
  \item \code{cvHigh}: data.table containing a boolean variable which indicates for each estimate if the estimated standard error exceeds \code{cv.limit}.
  \item \code{stEDecrease}: data.table indicating for each estimate the theoretical increase in sample size which is gained when averaging over k years. Only returned if \code{year.mean} is not \code{NULL}.
}
}
\description{
Calculate point estimates as well as standard errors of variables in surveys. Standard errors are estimated using bootstrap weights (see \code{\link{draw.bootstrap}} and \code{\link{recalib}}).
In addition the standard error of an estimate can be calcualted using the survey data for 3 or more consecutive years, which results in a reduction of the standard error.
}
\details{
\code{calc.stError} takes survey data (\code{dat}) and returns point estimates as well as their standard Errors defined by \code{fun} and \code{var} for each sample year in \code{dat}.
\code{dat} must be household data where household members correspond to multiple rows with the same household identifier. The data should at least containt the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item Column indicating the sample year;
  \item Column indicating the household ID;
  \item Column containing the household sample weights;
  \item Columns which contain the bootstrap weights (see output of \code{\link{recalib}});
  \item Columns listed in \code{var} as well as in \code{cross_var}
}
For each variable in \code{var} as well as sample year the function \code{fun} is applied using the original as well as the bootstrap sample weights.\cr
The point estimate is then selected as the result of \code{fun} when using the original sample weights and it's standard error is estimated with the result of \code{fun} using the bootstrap sample weights. \cr
\cr
\code{fun} can be any function which returns a double or integer and uses sample weights as it's second argument. The predifined options are \code{weightedRatio,weightedSum,sampSize} and \code{popSize}, for wich \code{sampSize} and \code{popSize} indicate the sample and population size respectively.\cr
\cr
For the option \code{weightedRatio} a weighted ratio (in \%) of \code{var} is calculated for \code{var} equal to 1, e.g \code{sum(weight[var==1])/sum(weight[!is.na(var)])*100}.\cr
\cr
If \code{cross_var} is not \code{NULL} but a vector of variables from \code{dat} then \code{fun} is applied on each subset of \code{dat} defined by all combinations of values in \code{cross_var}.\cr
For instance if \code{cross_var = "sex"} with "sex" having the values "Male" and "Female" in \code{dat} the point estimate and standard error is calculated on the subsets of \code{dat} with only "Male" or "Female" value for "sex". This is done for each value of \code{year}.
For variables in \code{cross_var} which have \code{NA}s in \code{dat} the rows containing the missings will be discarded. \cr
When \code{cross_var} is a list of character vectors, subsets of \code{dat} and the following estimation of the point estimate, including the estimate for the standard error, are calculated for each list entry.\cr
\cr
When defining \code{year.diff} the difference of point estimates between years as well their standard errors are calculated.\cr
The entries in \code{year.diff} must have the form of \code{"year1 - year2"} which means that the results of the point estimates for \code{year2} will be substracted from the results of the point estimates for \code{year1}.\cr
\cr
Specifying \code{year.mean} leads to an improvement in standard error by averaging the results for the point estimates, using the bootstrap weights, over \code{year.mean} years.
Setting, for instance, \code{year.mean = 3} the results in averaging these results over each consecutive set of 3 years.\cr
Estimating the standard error over these averages gives an improved estimate of the standard error for the central year, which was used for averaging.\cr
The averaging of the results is also applied in differences of point estimates. For instance defining \code{year.diff = "2015-2009"} and \code{year.mean = 3}
the differences in point estimates of 2014 and 2008, 2015 and 2009 as well as 2016 and 2010 are calcualated and finally the average over these 3 differences is calculated.
\cr
Setting \code{bias} to \code{TRUE} returns the calculation of a mean over the results from the bootstrap replicates. In  the output the corresponding columns is labeled \emph{_mean} at the end.\cr
\cr
If \code{fun} needs more arguments they can be set in add.arg.\cr
\cr
The parameter \code{size.limit} indicates a lower bound of the sample size for subsets in \code{dat} created by \code{cross_var}. If the sample size of a subset falls below \code{size.limit} a warning will be displayed.\cr
In addition all subsets for which this is the case can be selected from the output of \code{calc.stError} with \code{$smallGroups}.\cr
With the parameter \code{cv.limit} one can set an upper bound on the coefficient of variantion. Estimates which exceed this bound are flagged with \code{TRUE} and are available in the function output with \code{$cvHigh}.
\code{cv.limit} must be a positive integer and is treated internally as \%, e.g. for \code{cv.limit=1} the estimate will be flagged if the coefficient of variantion exceeds 1\%.\cr
\cr
When specifying \code{year.mean}, the decrease in standard error for choosing this method is internally calcualted and a rough estimate for an implied increase in sample size is available in the output with \code{$stEDecrease}.
The rough estimate for the increase in sample size uses the fact that for a sample of size \eqn{n} the sample estimate for the standard error of most point estimates converges with a factor \eqn{1/\sqrt{n}} against the true standard error \eqn{\sigma}.
