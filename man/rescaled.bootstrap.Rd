\usage{
rescaled.bootstrap(
  dat,
  method = c("Preston", "Rao-Wu"),
  REP = 1000,
  strata = "DB050>1",
  cluster = "DB060>DB030",
  fpc = "N.cluster>N.households",
  single.PSU = c("merge", "mean"),
  return.value = c("data", "replicates"),
  run.input.checks = TRUE,
  already.selected = NULL,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{either data frame or data table containing the survey sample}

\item{method}{for bootstrap replicates, either \code{"Preston"} or \code{"Rao-Wu"}}

\item{REP}{integer indicating the number of bootstraps to be drawn}

\item{strata}{string specifying the column name in \code{dat} that is used for
stratification. For multistage sampling multiple column names can be
specified by \code{strata=c("strata1","strata2","strata3")} or
\code{strata=c("strata1>strata2>strata3")}. See Details for more
information.}

\item{cluster}{string specifying the column name in \code{dat} that is used for
clustering. For instance given a household sample the column containing
the household ID should be supplied.
For multistage sampling multiple column names can be specified
by \code{cluster=c("cluster1","cluster2","cluster3")} or
\code{cluster=c("cluster1>cluster2>cluster3")}.
See Details for more information.}

\item{fpc}{string specifying the column name in \code{dat} that contains the
number of PSUs at the first stage. For multistage sampling the number of
PSUs at each stage must be specified by \code{strata=c("fpc1","fpc2","fpc3")}
or \code{strata=c("fpc1>fpc2>fpc3")}.}

\item{single.PSU}{either "merge" or "mean" defining how single PSUs need to
be dealt with. For \code{single.PSU="merge"} single PSUs at each stage are
merged with the strata or cluster with the next least number of PSUs. If
multiple of those exist one will be select via random draw. For
\code{single.PSU="mean"} single PSUs will get the mean over all bootstrap
replicates at the stage which did not contain single PSUs.}

\item{return.value}{either "data", "replicates" and/or "selection"
specifying the return value of the function. For "data" the survey data is
returned as class \code{data.table}, for "replicates" only the bootstrap replicates
are returned as \code{data.table}. For "selection" list of data.tables with
length of \code{length(strata)} is returned containing 1:\code{REP} 0-1 columns
indicating if a PSU was selected for each sampling stage.}

\item{run.input.checks}{logical, if TRUE the input will be checked before applying
the bootstrap procedure}

\item{already.selected}{list of data.tables or \code{NULL} where each data.table contains
columns in \code{cluster}, \code{strata} and additionally 1:\code{REP} columns containing
0-1 values which indicate if a PSU was selected for each bootstrap replicate.
Each of the data.tables corresponds to one of the sampling stages. First entry
in the list corresponds to the first sampling stage and so on.}

\item{seed}{integer specifying the seed for the random number generator.}
}
\value{
returns the complete data set including the bootstrap replicates or
just the bootstrap replicates, depending on \code{return.value="data"} or
\code{return.value="replicates"} respectively.
}
\description{
Draw bootstrap replicates from survey data using either the rescaled
bootstrap for stratified multistage sampling, presented by J. Preston
(2009) or the Rao-Wu boostrap by J. N. K. Rao and C. F. J. Wu (1988)
}
\details{
For specifying multistage sampling designs the column names in
\code{strata},\code{cluster} and \code{fpc} need to be seperated by ">".\cr
For multistage sampling the strings are read from left to right meaning that
the first vector entry or column name before the first ">" is taken as the column for
stratification/clustering/number of PSUs at the first and the last vector entry
or column after
the last ">" is taken as the column for stratification/clustering/number of
PSUs at the last stage.
If for some stages the sample was not stratified or clustered one must
specify this by "1" or "I", e.g. \code{strata=c("strata1","I","strata3")} or
\code{strata=c("strata1>I>strata3")} if there was
no stratification at the second stage or
\code{cluster=c("cluster1","cluster2","I")} respectively
\code{cluster=c("cluster1>cluster2>I")}
if there were no clusters at the last stage.\cr
The number of PSUs at each stage is not calculated internally and must be
specified for any sampling design.
For single stage sampling using stratification this can usually be done by
adding over all sample weights of each PSU by each strata-code.\cr
Spaces in each of the strings will be removed, so if column names contain
spaces they should be renamed before calling this procedure!\cr
If \code{already.selected} is supplied the sampling of bootstrap replicates
considers if speficif PSUs have already been selected by a previous survey wave.
For a specific \code{strata} and \code{cluster} this could lead to more than \code{floor(n/2)}
records selected. In that case records will be de-selected such that \code{floor(n/2)} records,
with \code{n} as the total number of records, are selected for each
\code{strata} and \code{cluster}. This parameter ist mostly used by \link{draw.bootstrap} in
order to consider the rotation of the sampling units over time.
